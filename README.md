# scoreboard application:
This React app can be used when playing sports, cards, or board games.  It allows you to add and remove players from the game and keep score by increasing and decreasing a 
score counter for each player.  Responsive dynamic information includes the total number of players and points, and provides a stopwatch that keeps track of turn time.  A fun
and competitive piece to the app is watching the crown icon next to the score leader's name change.

### This app consists of three components:
* A header - contains the title and stats, like the total nmber of players on the board
* A player - reuseable list of each player and score that lets you increase and decrease the player's score
* A container - wraps the entire app and brings everything together

The value of React breaking down code into smaller reusable pieces like players and counters, is the app becomes easier to work with.  Smaller components are easier to 
maintain than one large one.
